# Fake News Prediction

A machine learning project that uses natural language processing (NLP) to detect fake news articles based on their content.

---

## Objective

To develop a model that classifies news articles as **fake** or **real** using machine learning and text processing techniques.

---

## Dataset

- **File**: `data/news.csv`
- **Fields**: Typically includes `title`, `text`, and `label`
- **Labels**: `1` for fake news, `0` for real news

---

## Techniques Used

- Text preprocessing (removing punctuation, stopwords, etc.)
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression)
- Model Evaluation (accuracy)
